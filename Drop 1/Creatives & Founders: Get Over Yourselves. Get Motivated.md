# Creatives & Founders: Get Over Yourselves. Get Motivated.

Motivation is one of the hardest things for any human being to maintain. That’s why fitspo is a hugely important aspect of health and fitness on social media. It taps into the need for motivation that everyone has. Everyone knows that staying motivated enough to achieve goals is difficult.

But creatives and entrepreneurs take it a step further — we talk about motivation like it’s a ghost. Like it’s a wisp of something that we see and feel when we don’t expect it. Like it’s something we don’t entirely believe in at all.
We overthink it. We put too much emphasis on it, and we come up with self-important reasons about why we can or can’t complete our creative work. We give up on things, we say it’s impossible to work, and then we call it “Writers Block” — like that somehow excuses it.

We like to feel important and tragic. We like to think we’re all visionaries struggling with a titanic problem. All of us creatives are full of crap, myself included.

I’ve said this before, if you don’t have motivation you need to make some.

Here’s How.

## 1. Stop getting cosmic (nothing we do matters)

Have you ever thought about your place in the universe? I’m sure you’ve seen images like this going around:

Here’s the size of the sun compared to the rest of the galaxy. Your unfinished drafts are a lot smaller (not shown)
The galaxy is huge. It’s insanely big. And in something that big, your work isn’t even the tiniest sliver of a blip on the radar. That’s not meant to be depressing; it just means that if you want to make something earth shattering, you’re way off spec.

Douglas Coupland has a piece of writing advice that has stuck with me ever since I first read it:

Don’t Get Cosmic

When I first read that it blew my little mind. He’s 100% right. If you become caught up in asking yourself what your work means and whether it truly represents you and your tiny speck of atoms in this kind of ridiculous corner of the universe, you won’t finish jack shit.

And nobody will care, because they won’t know what they’re missing out on. They won’t know that their lives were a little poorer without the work you could have made.

## 2. Just take a leap

Sometimes, I think all you can do is take a flailing leap, arms going everywhere, screaming in panic. Take that leap into creating something, and trip and fall and then get right back up again. As long as you’re doing something you really thoroughly believe in, something you care about, it’s going to be okay.

Have a plan, always have a plan, but don’t worry about whether It’s right or wrong. Because it doesn’t matter if you fuck up or if you hate the way you started your company or creative project, you’ll still be in a better position than if you did nothing at all.

And on the subject of plans…

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have what it takes to be an actor, and I respect the hell out of anyone who tries. But I’ve seen people stall and die on stage whispering to the unseen forces out stage right for their line.

Sometimes it’s better to make something up, even if it doesn’t really represent the work that you imagined. Nobody in your audience and none of your users are going to realise that, and to them the whole thing will seem smooth.

## 3. Remember: The greatest visionaries still laughed at fart jokes.

(I have no evidence to support this. But they probably did.)

It’s dangerously bad for you to worship people. When you see other creatives, entrepreneurs or writers as being more than human, when you start to give them a mythological status, there’s no way you could ever feel good enough to do anything.

When you’re trying to maintain the motivation you need to finish a project, don’t look to other people as gurus. Find their best advice, sure. Follow their best advice, they probably know better than you. But don’t think that they’re Gods, remember that they were imperfect too. They were just like you.

I like to think that even Baez, Tesla, Jobs, Woolfe and Sandberg laughed at fart jokes. It reminds me that they were human.

## 4. Don’t keep asking for feedback

Let me clarify that. Feedback is incredibly important, and I doubt any of us could create anything of value without it. But there’s a time to take feedback, and that’s when a draft is finished. When every draft is finished. Nobody can give constructive criticism until they’ve seen your work as whole, even if it’s patched and battered and misshapen.

If you write three chapters of a book or the introduction to a business plan, that’s nothing. It’s not enough for anyone to have a firm grasp of what you’re trying to accomplish, so their feedback is going to be mostly bloody useless.

Any comments they make are probably going to do more harm than good because you’ll go back over an unfinished draft and re-do the work you’ve got.

Note: this is something I am particularly bad with, myself. I want people to validate my work while I’m still doing it. It’s a bad habit. Don’t be like me.

## 5. Kill your muse

Disclaimer: I don’t endorse actual violence against muses.

Having a muse can spark beautiful creative work, or help a company turn into a burning torch that lights the way. I mentioned Jobs and Baez before — it’s easy to see how they were muses for each other, Jobs in his search for meaning in technology and Baez as she adjusted to the new meaning that technology lent to music.

But you can’t rely on a muse for motivation. There reaches a point where you have to kill off that dependency, let it go, and live/work on your own two feet. I have no shame in admitting that I’m a big reader of fanfiction. I find it inspiring to see thousands upon thousands of writers, many of them quite young, letting their imagination run wild and producing works of fiction that range from abjectly terrible to damn near publishable.

It’s common to see these young authors leave their works unfinished and attribute it to “muse death”. What a tragedy that is!

Off topic, but creatives: don’t treat anyone like they’re your two-dimensional manic pixie muse. Nobody exists just to fuel your work.

## 6. Re-invent the wheel (or steal someone else’s)

Why is it the case that entrepreneurs are endorsed and encouraged when they find a better way of doing something that other people have already done — while creatives are told to be original and unique and criticised when their work echoes another?

If you don’t have motivation to create something, one of the best things to do is find another work that has already been completed and ask yourself how you can put your spin on it and recreate it in an all new way. There’s nothing wrong with disassembling and reverse engineering a work that you love and respect, and finding a way that you can make it your own.

I think the technical term for this is innovation. Stop being scared of it.
