#The Dreaded Internship…

Some insights from inside

Graduates starting out in the work force are confronted with a shopping list of obstacles and difficulties. In many fields, the number of positions is staggeringly small and the competition high. Adding to this is the dreaded internship.

In 2013 I began working in a full time position editing and co-ordinating content for a major Australian events website. Part of the role included managing a so called “Content Internship” program. The program purported to be a training ground for online journalism and creative writing. Unfortunately, the reality was completely different.

The interns performed tasks ranging from spreadsheet management, content sourcing, SEO, marketing, social media and more. They were paid nothing, which placed them lower on the income scale than the company’s outsourced workers in the Philippines.

The managing director of the company would continually state that empty desks not filled by interns were costing the company money. The general idea was, why should we pay students to do this work when we can have them work for free?

My attempts to run training programs to teach the interns valuable skills, or to have them take part in actually journalistic or blog writing activities were constantly met with questions about how that could be profitable and why the company should waste time on it instead of focusing on revenue streams.

Eventually, the pressure on the interns to perform tasks that were not related to their college studies and were not advertised in the job description became absurd, as they were given minimum KPI’s for administrative work that they were neither qualified for, nor interested in.

When I left the company, I vowed never to work in any position that required the abuse of young students’ need for experience in order to save money. Unfortunately, there are countless unpaid roles waiting to be filled by young people who are either not aware that they will be taken advantage of, or feel that there are no other options open to them.

The sad fact of the matter is that many roles that would once have been paid entry level roles have been turned into these so-called internship programs. The positions are rarely what they are made out to be, and often waste valuable months (or in some extreme cases, up to an entire year) of young job seekers’ time.

I am happy to come out and say this. As someone who has first hand experience of internship programs, believe me when I tell you that many internship programs are a blight. They are an abuse of power, an abuse of workers’ rights and a shameful example of corporate (and even startup) entitlement. While there may be some programs that are different, that can be a wonderful kick-start for a young graduate’s career, they are few and far between.

I’m not entirely sure what has to happen next. I’m not sure how the internship problem can be solved, how the trend can be turned around. But it does need to happen. Before it gets any worse.
